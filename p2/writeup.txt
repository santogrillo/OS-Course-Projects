Steps to doing assignment:

Goal: fill return address with address to first instruction of shell code

1. find vulnerability

    In line 150, the function casts length to type byte, any int where the last 8 bits in binary are less than 100 will pass the test.
    To test this, we ensured that our test string's length % 256 was less than 100.
    

2. look through shell storm (linux ones), intel x86
	we used shellstorm 882 shellcode and edited it to use port 5177

3. First Guess from print statement: addr+140: 3218678412


Structure of attack string:
    address guess, Nop, shellcode

    used 457 Nops

    70 addresses 

    These numbers were tweaked to ensure the length requirement

once we hacked into the server, we launched the shell we created in a new terminal and used an echo command to replace the contents of index.html

To find the remote address, we started with the machine address and added 457 (number of Nops) until we reached an address that worked.

The project was interesting and we learned a lot about how buffer overflow attacks work. However, guessing the address was very tedious and time consuming.
